### Practice Puzzles: Operators and Logical Comparisons

---

To start, set the following variables in your notebook for this homework:

```python
ayy = 2
bee = 7
sea = 1
dee = 8
```
#### Use operators to answer the following riddles. 

For each riddle, use [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) to print the output as a sentence – for example “The magic 8-ball declares that bee is greater than ayy!”

* Is ayy bigger than dee?
* Is ayy plus bee greater than dee?
* Is bee times ayy less than dee plus bee?
* Are **both** ayy less than bee **and** sea less than dee true?
* Are **both** bee plus sea equal to dee **and** ayy times bee plus ayy equal to ayy times dee true?

#### The `input()` function

To make our code interactive, we can give it the most basic of user interfaces: `input()`

#### input()` function

To make our code interactive, we can give it the most basic of user interfaces: `input()`

Try this in a code cell. After you run it, a little box will appear somewhere for you to type in (sorry Liberal Arts majors, that should be “…in which for you to type.”). It might be right under or over your code cell, or it might be at the top of the browser window. Type your name and hit <return>.

```python
my_name = input("Hi! I'm your code! What's your name? \n")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {my_name}! \n I'm your code, so you can call my anything...")
```
