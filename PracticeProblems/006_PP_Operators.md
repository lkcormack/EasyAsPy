### Practice Puzzles: Operators and Logical Comparisons

---

To start, set the following variables in your notebook for this homework:

```python
ayy = 2
bee = 7
sea = 1
dee = 8
```
#### Use operators to answer the following riddles. 

For each riddle, use [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) to print the output as a sentence – for example “The magic 8-ball declares that bee is greater than ayy!”

* Is ayy bigger than dee?
* Is ayy plus bee greater than dee?
* Is bee times ayy less than dee plus bee?
* Are **both** ayy less than bee **and** sea less than dee true?
* Are **both** bee plus sea equal to dee **and** ayy times bee plus ayy equal to ayy times dee true?

#### The `input()` function

To make our code interactive, we can give it the most basic of user interfaces: `input()`
