# Git and GitHub the easy way! 

(We’re LAMbs after all – we should be clever enough to do things the easy way if one exists!)

Download “github desktop” app. https://desktop.github.com/download/

Here, we are going to go through the basic steps of using GitHub and Git with the GitHub Desktop application! Please refer to the top 2 panels of GitHubFlowFigs.pdf early and often! We’re going to make a new repository (or “repo”  as the cool kids call it 😎) on the cloud, clone it on our very own computer (which literally builds the safe in the figure – a private vault for your code!), make some changes, push to the cloud, make some changes there, and pull those changes back to our machine so we always have our code right there in our hot little hands!

### Make a new repo on GitHub (“testRepo”, “myFirstRepo”, whatever)

Open Github desktop and login with your GitHub account.

Make a new repo! Choose the MIT license (which license doesn’t really matter for this). Make the repo “public” in case you want to practice interacting with coding buddies on GitHub.

### Clone Your Repo

Go to GitHub Desktop. Click on the Current Repository pull down menu (top left). Next, click on the Add pull down menu and select “Clone Repository…“ 

### add a markdown file (plain text file with a .md extension)

* you can use any editor you want

Note: you should find a nice simple multi-lingual text editor for writing simple markdown, code, whatever. Personally, I really like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows and [Moped](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moped-text-editor/id1477419086?mt=12) for Mac!

### commit and push

Do it! I do not doubt [your commitment to Sparkle Motion!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QJCn04dfek)

### edit file on github

Make any changes you want, but make sure you’ll be able to easily spot them.

### pull changes in github desktop

Verify that your changes made it to your local machine
